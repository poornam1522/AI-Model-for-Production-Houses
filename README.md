Movie Summarization and Paraphrasing with NLP and GPT-3
This project explores the exciting world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in movie data analysis and text paraphrasing. You'll leverage powerful tools like GPT-3 to build a sentence paraphrasing application.

Project Goals

Gain a solid foundation in NLP concepts and techniques.
Collect and process movie data for analysis.
Implement text vectorization using TF-IDF.
Explore Named Entity Recognition (NER) and data visualization techniques.
Build a sentence paraphrasing application using GPT-3.
Deploy the paraphrasing application on AWS Lambda (optional).
Key Learnings

Core NLP concepts like text tokenization, TF-IDF, and word vectors.
Techniques for movie data collection and parsing.
Data visualization libraries like Streamlit.
Using SpaCy for named entity recognition.
Sentence Transformers and topic modeling.
Building an AI-powered application with GPT-3.
(Optional) Cloud deployment with AWS Lambda.
Project Structure

The project consists of several modules, each focusing on a specific NLP concept or application:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
